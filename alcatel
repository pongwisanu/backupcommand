Managing the configuration files
Alcatel Omniswitchs can operate in two modes: working and certified (show running-directory to know in which mode the switch is). In working mode, the configuration can be modified, while it is no possible in certified mode (well, actually, it is). When booting, if working and certified configuration files are different, the switch will boot in certified mode. Configuration files are stored in certifed/boot.cfg and working/boot.cfg (they can be directly edited with “vi”).

save running -> working: write memory
save working -> certified: copy working certified [flash-synchro], flash-synchro will synchronize the conf accross all slots
save running even in certified mode: configuration snapshot all <file> Then move this file to working/boot.cfg
reboot in working mode without rollback: reload working no rollback-timeout
view running configuration: show configuration snapshot [all|vlan|ip|...] or write terminal
When modifying the configuration, it can be useful to reload the switch in certified mode if a configuration error occur. It is possible to program the switch to reload a few minutes ahead in case you lose control: reload in <n> where n is the number of minutes to wait before reloading. A reload can be canceled with reload cancel. show reload will show you when the switch will reboot.

Configure VLANs
A layer 2 VLAN is created with vlan <vlan_number> enable name "vlan name" and removed with no vlan <vlan_number>. show vlan lists all VLANs, show vlan <vlan_number> shows vlan <vlan_number> details.
Depending on the microcode version (show microcode), a layer 3 VLAN is created using:

ip interface "interface name" vlan <vlan_number> address <address> mask <netmask>
vlan router "interface name" vlan <vlan_number> address <address> mask <netmask>
and destroyed with:

no ip interface "interface name"
no vlan router "interface name"
Port association:

To associate a port to a specific vlan: vlan <vlan_number> port default <slot>/<port>
To list the ports: show vlan port
To list the ports of a specified vlan: show vlan <vlan_number> port
To show a port: show vlan port <slot>/<port>
802.1Q:

To tag a port: vlan <vlan_number> 802.1Q <slot>/<port> [<"comment">]
To remove a tag: vlan <vlan_number> no 802.1Q <slot>/<port>
Interfaces
Global status: Show interfaces status
Info about an interface (admin status, MAC, speed, duplex, errors, …): show interfaces [port|status|<slot>/<port>|...]
Summary of interfaces errors: show interfaces counters errors
To clear counters: interfaces <slot>[/port1-port2] no l2 statistics
To change an interface: interface <slot>/<port> [speed <10_100_1000>|duplex <half_full>|autoneg <state>|flood rate <rate>]
To switch from autonegociation to 100FD, set

autoneg off
speed 100 and duplex full
If forced in 100FD while autoneg is on, the port will stay down
To disable an interface: interface <slot>/<port> admin down

Link Aggregation
Dynamic LAG (LACP)
lacp linkagg <id> size <size> admin state enable
lacp linkagg <id> actor admin key <key>
lacp agg <slot/port> actor admin key <key>

Static LAG
static linkagg <id> size <size> admin state enable
static linkagg <id> name <name>
static agg <slot/port> agg num <id>

Hardware
When stacking is operational, one switch is primary, one other secondary, the others idle. If the primary disappears, the secondary becomes primary and the first idle becomes secondary.
Get info about the chassis: show chassis and about the stack: show stack topology.

To monitor the health of the system: show health all (cpu|memory)

Show CMM (Control Management Module – Alcatel ) information: show cmm

System
Uptime, date, name, contact, location: show system
To change:

system name <"name">
system contact <"contact">
system location <"location">
The default prompt is “->”. session prompt default "sw1->" changes it to “sw1->”. You can get the other session parameters with show session config

When a command outputs to many lines on the screen, it is possible to use “more” to see page by page. Use more to activate the mode and more size <size> to set the number of lines shown. Cancel this mode with no more.

To change the timeout of the telnet/ssh sessions: session timeout cli <timeout>

NTP
Set a server: ntp server <server_ip>. Even if the DNS is configured, you cannot specify a name for the NTP server. Then activate NTP: ntp client enable.
Get NTP info:

show ntp client: tells if NTP is on or off, when was the last updated, …
show ntp server-list: get the list of servers and with which server the swich is synchronized
Logs
Show logging conf: show swlog
Get switch logs:

show log swlog: get all logs
show log swlog timestamp <mounth/day/year> <hour:minute>: only logs since the specified hour
empty logs: swlog clear
Enable syslog with: swlog output socket <syslog_server_ip>

STP
STP can operates in two modes: flat and 1×1. In flat mode, there is only one instance for the whole switch whereas in 1×1 mode, there is one instance per VLAN (like pvst on Cisco switches or vstp on Juniper ones). I recommend the 1×1 mode if you do not want to go the MSTP way. Change STP mode: bridge mode (flat|1x1)

Get STP conf: show spantree

It is possible to deactivate STP on specified vlans/ports : vlan <vlan_number> stp (enable|disable) and bridge <vlan_number> <slot>/<port> (enable|disable)

Change STP algorithm: bridge protocol (802.1D|STP|RTSP). (In 2007), I did not manage to set rstp for all vlan as a global config, I had to set it vlan per vlan using: bridge 1x1 <vlan_number> protocol (802.1D|STP|RTSP).

DNS
Name servers: ip name-server <IP1> <IP2>
Domain name: ip domain-name <domain-name>
Activate DNS client: ip domain-lookup
DHCP relay
ip service udp-relay
DHCP relay only for specified vlans: ip helper per-vlan only
DHCP server address: ip helper address <dhcp_server> vlan <vlan_number>
Enable DHCP relay: ip udp relay BOOTP
Services
Activate/deactivate services: [no] ip service (ftp|ssh|telnet|http|secure-http|udp-relay|snmp|all). List of activated services: show ip service.
For https: ip http ssl

AAA
Authentification can be local or made with a radius
To activate a service, the authentification have to be set: aaa authentification default "local", aaa authentification (console|ssh|ftp|802.1X|vlan|...) "local"

ARP
ARP table: show arp
Mac Address table: show mac-address-table
Add a static MAC/IP entry: arp <IP> <MAC>, no arp <IP> to remove it.
Clear dynamic arp entries: clear arp-table
To specify when an dynamic entry timeouts (default: 300seconds): mac-address-table aging-time <seconds> [vlan <vlan_number>]

SNMP
First, you have to create a user and give it the right to do SNMP:

user <"username"> read-only (all|ip|interface|...) password <password>
The only way I found to give the user SNMP capabilities is to use the web interface …, but you can desactivate it with user <"username"> no snmp
Then configure the snmp server:

snmp security no security
Associate the community string with the user you created: snmp community map <"community"> user <"username"> on
To configure the SNMP trap server: snmp station <server_ip> [<port>] <"user"> (v1|v2c|v3) enable
snmp authentification trap (enable|disable)
To filter the traps sent by the switch: snmp trap filter <server_ip> <filter_code>
Port mirroring
Port mirroring works 12 ports by 12 ports. It is possible to configure multiple sources for one session and thus see the traffic of multiple ports in one output.

show port mirroring status
port mirroring <session> source <slot>/<port> destination <slot>/<port> enable
no port mirroring <session>
POE
By default, the POE is disabled on all ports.
To enable the POE on a given port: lanpower start <slot>/<port>
To enable it on the whole slot: lanpower start <slot>

To stop the POE, use the symmetric commande lanpower stop (<slot>/<port>|<slot>)

Show the POE configuration: show lanpower <slot>

To limit the power available for a given port: lanpower <slot>/<port> power <milliwatts>
To limit the power available for a slot: lanpower <slot> maxpower <watts>

A power of 230W is enough for a full slot equipped with IP Phones (note: TBC).
It has been noticed that a switch may prove instable with POE if too many equipments are connected and its PSU is not enough powerfull.

QOS & ACL
In AOS, ACL and QoS are configured in the same “qos” section.
Apply QoS when modified: qos apply
Disable QoS (useful for troubleshooting): qos disable

By default, QOS is not trusted in access ports and all tags are set to 0. It is trusted on trunked ports. To trust everywhere: qos trust ports
To trust on one given port: qos port <slot>/<port> trusted

The rules are a combinaison of the following elements:

policy network : define subnets
policy condition : define conditions (from subnet1 to subnet2, …)
policy action : define actions (permit, deny, …)
policy rule : apply action to condition (if X then Y)
The syntax for the different blocks is the following:
policy network group <gp_name> <subnet1> mask <mask1> <subnet2> mask <mask2> ...
policy condition <c_name> source network group <gp_name1> destination group <gp_name2>
policy action <a_name> disposition <action>
policy rule <r_name> [disable] precedence <p> condition <c_name> action <a_name>, where precedence is the order rules can be applied

As an example:

policy network group VoIP 192.168.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0 192.168.11.0 mask 255.255.254.0
policy network group Data 172.16.0.0 mask 255.255.255.0

policy condition "VoIP-VoIP" source network group VoIP destination network group VoIP
policy condition "VoIP-Data"  source network group VoIP destination network group Data
policy condition "Data-Data" source network group Data destination network group Data
policy condition "Other" source ip any destination ip any

policy action Deny disposition deny
policy action Permit

policy rule "Allow VoIP-VoIP" precedence 200 condition "VoIP-VoIP" action Permit
policy rule "Allow VoIP-Data" disable precedence 200 condition "VoIP-Data" action Permit
policy rule "Allow Data-Data" precedence 200 condition "Data-Data" action Permit
policy rule "Deny Other" precedence 200 condition "Other" action Deny
